# ACM API Coverage

## Overview

Spinifex implements **9 operations** in the ACM `2015-12-08` API model.

### Import and issuance

Spinifex both stores externally-issued certificates and issues its own for load balancer listener references. Certificates are account-scoped, and a delete is refused while any listener still references the ARN — there is no force flag, matching AWS.

`RequestCertificate` mints an ARN immediately and returns `PENDING_VALIDATION`; it never issues inline except against a tenant private CA, which has no domain to validate. The validation mode is derived from deployment state rather than configured: the DNS provider API where a credential exists, a manual TXT record where the platform hosts the zone, and a private CA otherwise — the only option for a deployment with no publicly delegated domain.

Terraform's canonical certificate, DNS record and validation flow works unmodified in every mode. Where Spinifex owns the record write it emits no `ResourceRecord`, so iterating the validation options yields zero records and the validation resource still blocks correctly by polling until the certificate is issued.

### Operations

| Operation |
|---|
| `AddTagsToCertificate` |
| `DeleteCertificate` |
| `DescribeCertificate` |
| `GetCertificate` |
| `ImportCertificate` |
| `ListCertificates` |
| `ListTagsForCertificate` |
| `RemoveTagsFromCertificate` |
| `RequestCertificate` |

### Requires AWS SDK v2

These 25 operations are in the pinned AWS model but not in AWS SDK for Go v1, the SDK Spinifex is built and tested on. They are out of scope until Spinifex moves to AWS SDK v2.

| `DeleteAcmeExternalAccountBinding` |
| `DescribeAcmeAccount` |
