# STS API Coverage

## Overview

Spinifex implements **5 operations** in the STS `2011-06-15` API model.

### Trust policies

Trust policies are validated at write time rather than silently narrowed at assume time. `NotPrincipal`, `NotAction`, empty-string `Action` elements and empty `Principal` blocks are all rejected as malformed.

`Condition` blocks are rejected except on `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` with `StringEquals`, which is the shape IRSA needs and which Spinifex evaluates at assume time against the token's issuer, subject and audience. Anything wider is refused rather than accepted and ignored, because an accepted-but-unevaluated condition is a silent over-grant.

### Parameters that are refused, not ignored

Several inputs the model describes are deliberately rejected rather than accepted as no-ops: inline session policies and policy ARNs, session tags, and MFA serial numbers and token codes. Each of them would otherwise appear to restrict or strengthen a session that in fact carries the role's full permissions.

### Operations

| Operation |
|---|
| `AssumeRole` |
| `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` |
| `GetAccessKeyInfo` |
| `GetCallerIdentity` |
| `GetSessionToken` |

### Requires AWS SDK v2

These 3 operations are in the pinned AWS model but not in AWS SDK for Go v1, the SDK Spinifex is built and tested on. They are out of scope until Spinifex moves to AWS SDK v2.

| Operation |
|---|
| `AssumeRoot` |
| `GetDelegatedAccessToken` |
| `GetWebIdentityToken` |
